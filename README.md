# Document Generation

Using the fact that an ODT is just a zip and the text is an XML (content.xml), this utility uses XSL for generating a document from a template written in ODT.

## list

This is a list which template supports a variable number of columns.

- [template](docs/list/report.odt)
- [xml](docs/list/report.xml)
- [xsl](docs/list/report.xsl)
- [result](docs/list/report.pdf)

## Contests

This is a *double list*: the first is the contest and for each of them a second list with the questions.

- [template](docs/contests/report.odt)
- [xml](docs/contests/report.xml)
- [xsl](docs/contests/report.xsl)
- [result](docs/contests/report.pdf)
